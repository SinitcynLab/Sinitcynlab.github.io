# Sinitcyn Lab Website

This repository contains the Jekyll site for the Sinitcyn Lab, focusing on computational mass spectrometry and AI-driven proteomics.

- `_posts/` contains news items that populate `/news/`
- `_data/members.yml` and `_data/publications.yml` drive the Members and Publications pages
- `assets/css/main.css` holds the bespoke styling for the theme
